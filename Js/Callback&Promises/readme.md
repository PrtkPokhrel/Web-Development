**Syncronous**
It means that the program runs in order      

**Asyncronous**
It means that the code will run in order but when the particular instruction takes longer time the instruction is left to run paralelly resultinig in the execution of another instruction and when the parallely runed instruction finished its execution the output will be placed immediately

example:
code1
code2
api(takes 2 second delay so this is skipped)
code3
code4
api(completed in 2 second, hence the api is placed here)
